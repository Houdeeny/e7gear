# What is this?
This is a web tool for Epic Seven players to determine the quality of their gear based on substats.

# How do I use this?
1. Select the gear's level.
2. Select the gear's grade.
3. Select the enhancement level.
4. Fill in the gear's substats.
5. Click the "Calculate" button.
# How to decide which gear is worth to keep/upgrade?
1) The gear score percentage will have different colors according to the quality of your gear.
- GREEN: The gear rolled well so it is obviously a keeper.
- YELLOW: The gear is usable, definitely keep it if you are early to midgame.
- RED: The gear rolled terribly low and you are advised to not enhance it any further.

2) The gear's total score is not high enough, but at least one of the substat has very good value.

3) One of the substat is equal/higher than player's expectation.
# Known Issue(s)
- The ranges for flat attack, flat defense and flat health may not be precisely correct.
- Reforged gear score might show up incorrectly sometimes.
# Something to note..
There is no functional difference in this version of calculator compared to the original.
I simply made it easier to the eyes, mobile friendly and minor performance improvements.
